# Health System Monitor

This project is a Python script that monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage. The project is intended for anyone who needs to troubleshoot their computer or
to keep track of their laptop's health. I used Python, JSON, and psutil library to build the monitor.




## Future Work

In the future, I will automate alerts and visualization by using DevOps tools.
## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  python3 system_monitor.py
```
