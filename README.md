# Health System Monitor

This project is a Python script that monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage. The project is intended for anyone who needs to troubleshoot their computer or
to keep track of their laptop's health. I used Python, JSON, and psutil library to build the monitor.


## Future Work

In the future, I will automate alerts and visualization by using DevOps tools.
